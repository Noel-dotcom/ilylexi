  <h1>Main Love Letter</h1>
  <div class="letter">
My Lexi,

I hope you know that you matter to me a lot and I love you, you are my best friend, my soul mate, my family, and most important of all, my lover. I really don‚Äôt mean to hurt you, I only want the best for you. When we stopped talking, that was the lowest point of my life, you‚Äôre really the only good thing in my life and I can‚Äôt lose you. I really just feel bad you have to be with someone like me, I only make you suffer. I honestly am trying my best for you, I want to give and treat you the best. I‚Äôll never leave you again, the only way you‚Äôll get me to leave is if you kill me. Kahit pa nga itaboy mo ako palayo, hinding hindi kita iiwan. 

Every time I make you upset or do something to hurt you I just always get uneasy, I always get nauseous and will lose my appetite, I just really don‚Äôt wanna hurt you. Di makatulog at makakain pag wala ka. I‚Äôll kill my pride just for you, you matter a lot to me, and I don‚Äôt want you gone and hurting you. You‚Äôre my medicine, you always make me feel better when life gets too hard. I need you, my medicine. 

You‚Äôre someone who I always want by my side and no one else. No one can replace you, it‚Äôll always just be you. You‚Äôre the only person I love. I love my Lexi, I love my girlfriend, I love my wife, I love my sweetheart, I love my darling, and I love you.

Forever yours,  
Noel
