  <h1>Main Love Letter</h1>
  <div class="letter">
My Lexi,

I hope you know that you matter to me a lot and I love you, you are my best friend, my soul mate, my family, and most important of all, my lover. I really don‚Äôt mean to hurt you, I only want the best for you. When we stopped talking, that was the lowest point of my life, you‚Äôre really the only good thing in my life and I can‚Äôt lose you. I really just feel bad you have to be with someone like me, I only make you suffer. I honestly am trying my best for you, I want to give and treat you the best. I‚Äôll never leave you again, the only way you‚Äôll get me to leave is if you kill me.

Every time I make you upset or do something to hurt you I just always get uneasy, I always get nauseous and will lose my appetite, I just really don‚Äôt wanna hurt you. I‚Äôll kill my pride just for you, you matter a lot to me, and I don‚Äôt want you gone and hurting you. You‚Äôre my medicine, you always make me feel better when life gets too hard. I need you, my medicine. 

You‚Äôre someone who I always want by my side and no one else. No one can replace you, it‚Äôll always just be you. You‚Äôre the only person I love. I love my Lexi, I love my girlfriend, I love my wife, I love my sweetheart, I love my darling, and I love you.

Forever yours,  
Noel
